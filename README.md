tiger football:

A way to develop a prototype design using the Skrollr library. Playing with weaving text
in front of and behind images to create a sense of depth/presentation
variety. Emphasizing minimalistic UI. Still needs some screws
tightened, looks best in a smallish browser window so the text lines up
with the images.
